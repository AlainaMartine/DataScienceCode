For this repository there is the original data file which shows the original demographics and participant numbers. Importantly, gender is included. 
Then, I created the files from the original study demographics to include separate male and female data and their results.
These were then ran in the male and female code (also included). Results are reported in my paper.

All original data comes from the Leuker 2019 paper, which is included here also.
